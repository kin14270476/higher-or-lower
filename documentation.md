### I. Initiative
This project is a game where a user can guess if a number is higher or lower.

### II. Epics and User Stories

##### Epics
* Program will create 2 random number between 1 and 10
* User is able to see 1 of the random number and will be able to chose if it is higher or lower than the other number
* Program will be in a command line interface 

##### Non-Functional Requirements
* The player will have 3 lives and each time they guess wrong their life will go down by one and once all lives are gone the game will be over and it will display how many guess they got right.
* The player will be given certain amount currency in which they can wager withand they will get money back if they win and they will lose the money that they wagered if they lose.
*

##### User Stories
Written in the format: 

As a player, I would to be able to continue the game without having to refresh the page.

##### Coding Standards
###### Variable Naming and Location
* All variables must have appropriate names with capital letter for the first letter.
* Variable must be correctly spelt.
* Each variable must be initiated at the top of document along with importing a module.
###### Brackets
* Curly brackets should appear in the line below if statement or the while loop.  
###### Commenting
