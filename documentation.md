### I. Initiative
This project is a game where a user can guess if a number is higher or lower.

### II. Epics and User Stories

##### Epics
* Program will create 2 random number between 1 and 10
* User is able to see 1 of the random number and will be able to chose if it is higher or lower than the other number
* Program will be in a command line interface 

##### Non-Functional Requirements
* The player will have 3 lives and each time they guess wrong their life will go down by one and once all lives are gone the game will be over and it will display how many guess they got right.
* The player will be given certain amount currency in which they can wager withand they will get money back if they win and they will lose the money that they wagered if they lose.
*

##### User Stories
Written in the format: 

As a player, I would to be able to continue the game without having to refresh the page.


##### How We Addressed The Requirements

How will your planned product meet the user requirements

### III. Genre

### IV. Technical Details

##### Platform
Windows/Linix/Mac depending on where it compiled

##### Programming Language/Enviroment
C++ was used to make this program with the programming enviroment of Repl.it 

##### Programming Challenges
State the programing challenges you are trying to overcome
 
##### Constructing And Implementing My Code

Think of this as the method. How will you go about building your program?

##### Algorithms

Explanation of the algorithms behind your program
 
##### Coding Standards 
All vaibles must have appropriate names with capital letter for the first letter. Each varible must be initiated at the top of document along with importing a modula. After each if statement or loop has been initiated there will be an indetation to make the code easier to read and to work out if a section of code is in a loop. Each comment has been writen at the end of the line so that reader will know what the comment is in refernce. Comments will be writen for each IF stament, loop and vaible.
